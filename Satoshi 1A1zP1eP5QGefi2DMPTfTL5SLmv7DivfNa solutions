>my adopted name is Johann Elmer Hulstrom my birth name is Marshall B Mathers lll
>my best frien Brian Beavers knew this and guided me to making my rap name Marshall Mathers before I knew it was adopted how he knew what my name was when I didn't and how he knew I was adopted when I didn't maybe someone from my adopted family guided him maybe it was an angel that guided him however he knew I am blessed to have him as a best friend he's a hell of a rapper too then he knew beating me the day he gave me the rap name Marshall Mathers I was so excited to be Marshall Mathers that when the Detroit Tigers interviewed me and asked me how long I was going to Monzturr Madness baseball I was shook because I could never imagine myself not playing in some capacity until I collapse was my response.
>I asked if I could use my rap name instead because Johann was mispronounced and made people laugh at me when I came up to bayside they said call yourself what ever you want just keep turning double Monzturr Madness and that's when I said I was the double M a friend gave me the nickname manic at a party I was doing and I did songs with various people who ever was around and was set up to record I recorded with them never thinking that it would go far enough for anyone to want to listen to me rap as I thought it was horrible and I didn't like the way I sounded so I was all ways like don't use those recording I don't like the way I sound on them
>then I met Dre in Huntington Beach California and asked him for some marijuana after a round of surfing on spring break one year and he said with a drawn gun on me that I better know how to rap so I was like oh shit so I raped the new song he was bumping and then he said he had a garage with a studio in it would I like to go record some raps  so I asked how much weed did he have and I need a drink of some whiskey too he said what ever you want  he would get it for me so after a missing persons report from my sister who lived in HB and 40 hours of recording and a call to Brian Beavers about the album we had come up with I delivered Marshall mathers aka slim shady to the radio I never heard the final versions so when it hit I didn't really recognize it or my voice and that was good I guess I was all ways told by my father to not get a big head and that nobody was ever gonna listen to that crap it wasn't music and that I better never think I was going to make a dime off of it either same thing he said to me about baseball and the rest of my family as well riding me about wasting my time with things that were never gonna work out for me
>so I pushed the memories away and repressed them almost to be lost forever until pictures surfaced that were not photoshopped to protect my identity they said but really it was to say that it wasn't me anyways the Detroit tigers flew me into town and let me take batting practice with them before a game and then in the locker room snapped a picture of me in a white Detroit tigers jacket I had to choose white or black I chose the white one it shined bright I had a chew in my lip and a black eye still from getting hit with a ball earlier that season when batting a curve ball never curved and I didn't turn my head back in time so still to this day it's a scar on the left eyebrow they will probably try and photoshop that out now too. Anyway I went to a house that night driven there by the clubhouse manager and there were a few fellows the making a rap album and asked me if I could rap so I did and gave my input to on what I liked and the direction to take with it all that was the start of D-12 a picture was taken at the end of the night before I hit the plane back to Seattle I guess so I wouldn't get a big head about it all I repressed those memories too until I saw the pictures and about shit my pants I even said the group photo that they would try and say it wasn't us until this photo surface to prove who the originals were and are still to this day as-13 is around me 35/7 working hard for us to stay real ebt now in the midst of re-recording and updating the portfolio it has all come full circle tushing back at me with Hollywood the way it is and the music biz too saying they want to protect you my family is still lying to me saying it's not me even tho I recorded revival and all of the other ones too years before the release of them just long enough for me to forget who I was
